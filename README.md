# disMAT

>**disMAT** is a combination of the words **dyscalculia** (in Portuguese, *discalculia*) and **mathematics**

This is a gaming therapeutic tool that consists of a mobile game, **disMAT**, with evolving exercises whose records are linked to a web application, **Discalculia Web**, where the person in charge can view the childâ€™s performance, evolution, screening, and guidance.
This application has the purpose to assist children from the age range 5-10 with mathematical learning disabilities, and dyscalculia, in an attractive and fun way.
Its purpose entails to appeal children to train their mathematical abilities in a three levels game, where the difficulty is distributed across a set of tasks (being used ten at each level) that intend to stimulate the brain`s areas affected by dyscalculia ([Ferraz, Vicente, et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.13052/jsn2445-9739.2016.004)).
It is available in two languages - English and Portuguese. Each screen view with written words has an associated button that reads all the content of that view, turning this application valuable for children who can read, who cannot read and who have difficulties in reading but want to test their knowledge in mathematic. Furthermore, it is important to refer that this application runs under the Android Operative System (OS) since it is the OS most common in the target population ([Ferraz et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-56538-5_25)).

It is available the first version. It do not include the inference system.
